# CS360AndroidProject

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The requirements for the application that I developed were to create an application that allowed users to login and create/view/edit items inside of a database of   inventory items. The users needs for this app would include logging in or signing up in additon to the creation and deletion of inventory items.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    The screens that were necessary for this application were the login page, sign up page, inventory view page, new item page, and the profile page. My UI was simplistic and easy to understand for my users. I didn't use any designs in particular to focus on my users and my designs were successful because I followed basic guidelins on the Android Development Page.
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I decided to approach my application design by dividing and conquering. I decided to just work on one feature a day in order to fully focus and ensure that the features worked the way they were supposed to. This can be applied in the future because if I am apart of a team dividing the tasks would allow each of us to finish the task much faster. If I'm working by myself I will have more experience for next time so the project will be a little easier as I have much more knowledge than last time.
    
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I tested my code by running it locally several times and testing and retesting features to ensure they worked in many cases. I found out that my database had no checks for null data so I had to modify my buttons so that they only worked when the fields were filled out because this would cause the app to continually crash. I also found that none of page elements were properly put onto the page.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I had to innovate to overcome a challenge when I designed my two databases. I had never made a database using SQL before and it was a challenge getting the fields to work properly.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  The component I did best at in the mobile application was the inventory page.
